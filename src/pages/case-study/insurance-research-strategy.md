## The Challenge

Pekin Insurance was facing challenges with outdated digital platforms that struggled to meet the evolving expectations of agents and insured customers. These gaps weren’t just technical. They reflected a deeper disconnect between user needs and business priorities. As the Digital Experience Manager, I led the charge to redefine the company’s approach through a digital experience strategy, which incorporated establishing a UX research practice. This effort wasn’t just about modernizing, it was about transforming the company's mindset to embrace user-centered practices as a catalyst for innovation.

## Solution

The digital transformation at Pekin Insurance began delivering tangible results, marking significant progress in improving user experiences for both agents and insured customers. To ensure continued improvement, I established a UX research frameworkthat focused on usability evaluations, accessibility testing, and standardized processes for collecting and analyzing data.

## Research Process

The team used a user-centered design approach to answer our research question. I conducted 3 of 8 user interviews and analyzed the results with my team to gather insights. Once clear opportunities for an integrated experience arose, we began the conceptual designs and prototyping. Lastly, we conducted usability evaluations to refine our approach.
<img src="/images/navigate-the-tate/process.png" style="width: 70%; display:flex; margin: 2rem auto;" alt="The user centered design process is research current experience, define the problem, design the concept and prototype, conduct usability evaluations, and iterate designs" />

### User Interviews

I led 3 of 8 user interviews, and 20-40 key data points were gathered per contextual inquiry. Each key data point was mapped to an affinity diagram to identify themes and insight clusters. ‍Due to the large amounts of data collected and diagrammed, only a portion of the mapped data is shown below. ‍
<img src="/images/navigate-the-tate/interview-diagram.png" style="width: 70%; display:flex; margin: 2rem auto;" alt="A screen capture of an affinity diagram" />

### Personas and User Journeys

I took primary responsibility for mapping user attributes to a persona spectrum and drafted personas for gallery visitors. The team worked together to create a lightweight journey map. Through the interviews, we identified key scenarios which later informed our usability studies. This included finding an admissions barcode, purchasing an item from the gift shop, and finding specific art pieces. ‍ The study uncovered the goals and pain points of gallery visitors.

### Insight Analysis

I collaborated with my team to reflect museum visitors' problem statements into feature opportunities.

    </div>
    <div class="text-col">
        <p>
            <b>Motivations</b><br>
            An art gallery visit can be an easy unplanned activity for people. If a gallery is nearby, visiting it is an activity people can do with minimal planning.     
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Facilities</b><br>
            People's expectations of facilities and actual facilities do not align. Most visitors do not have enough time or energy to tour the full gallery due to it large size, lack of air conditioning, or limited available seating.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Art Viewing</b><br>
            People prefer self-guided tours over staff-led tours. They use maps, videos, and posted information available within the museum to learn about the art or exhibit.
        </p>

By diagramming these features on a feature-priority matrix, we were able to prioritize key features to include in our conceptual prototype and create user stories. A report-out of our insights can be found below to showcase research summary deliverables.

### Concept Diagram
Once the features to be included in the prototype were identified, I created a concept map to visualize interactions and relationships between features, users, and gallery staff.

## Research Outcomes
Once our team agreed on the direction of the solution and prioritized features, we started designing and evaluating those designs. I started by creating low-fidelity wireframes to iterate the design and get early feedback with low effort. I then created mid-fidelity wireframes and a working prototype in Axure for usability testing. The interactive prototype enabled users to click through to fully test the scenarios they were given, and Axure provided the most interactive features at the time.
<img src="/images/navigate-the-tate/tate-wireframes.png" style="width:100%; display:flex; margin: 0 auto;" alt="Four wireframes are shown, on the left, a low fidelity wireframe, next to it the same design but annotated, and then a mid fidelity and higher fidelity design" />

We conducted tests of the interactive prototype to collect quantitative and qualitative data to assess the usability and user experience of the product. The evaluations were conducted online over Zoom and in person. The evaluation tasks focused on the user's ability to navigate the gallery, find specific exhibitions, and request and purchase a postcard of a chosen art piece.

I used tables to record the number and type of errors committed, the number of times the user asked for instruction, and the success or failure of each task. Participants were asked to rate the difficulty of each task on a scale of 1-5 and provide reasons for their ratings.

‍ After completing the tasks, a debriefing session was conducted to clarify any observed obstacles or confusing situations, gather more details about emotional reactions, and ask participants to rate their agreement with statements about their experience and willingness to use the product. ‍


### Key Learnings

- Data analysis showed that all users completed the Cezanne ticket selection task, but some users had errors or confusion regarding buying tickets or accessing tickets already purchased.
- Users generally responded positively and expressed satisfaction with the app, but some suggested design changes and clarifications for certain features, such as clickable images.

### Improvement Opportunities

- One user had an issue sharing her screen, which impacted the evaluation.
- Some users were uncertain whether they were using the app as a user with an account or as a first-time user, leading to minor errors.
- Reviewing the protocol, which was created collaboratively, revealed attachments UX team members had to their ideas, resulting in leading questions.
