### Internal Interviews
To understand the full landscape of user interactions, I conducted interviews across underwriting, claims, helpdesk, and other business areas. These conversations provided a nuanced understanding of how agents and insured customers interact with the company and highlighted internal perceptions about customer experience.

<div style="padding: 10px; text-align: center;">
        <div style="display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr));

                text-align: left;
            ">     
             <p style="color: #555;">
                Agents were seen as "the real customers" by internal teams due to their role in generating revenue and being supported by IT and business initiatives.
                </p>
            </div>
            <!-- Card 2 -->
            <div style="

                <p style="color: #555;">
                    Insured customers, skewing more senior (55+) and residing in rural areas, often faced challenges with unsupported legacy apps and limited digital tools.

            ">
                <p style="color: #555;">
                    There was hesitancy to engage directly with insured customers, with concerns that it might create tension with agents.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>

> Impact: These insights highlighted a significant gap in how the organization prioritized user groups, shaping the need for equitable solutions that addressed both agent and insured pain points.

### Service Design
Collaborating with the claims team, I developed a service blueprint to map the end-to-end claims journey. This exercise identified friction points, such as:

- Delayed communication between agents and claims representatives, leading to longer resolution times.
- Inconsistent reporting tools that added confusion to the process.
- Reliance on manual workflows, causing inefficiencies at multiple touchpoints.

> Outcome: The blueprint provided a clear visualization of the claims process, pinpointing opportunities for automation, streamlined communication, and improved user flows.

### Customer Interviews
Building trust with agents was critical for uncovering the real challenges they faced. Through interviews conducted by office visits and phone calls, I learned how their frustrations with existing tools impacted their ability to serve insured customers.

- Agents often relied on their own tools, bypassing our systems.
- Agents expressed a strong desire for more self-service capabilities for customers, especially for - processes like Claims, where they are the middle person between the customer and the company.
- Agents voiced skepticism in the company's ability to build reliable digital solutions.
- Many agents were eager for Pekin to align with modern industry standards.

>Impact: These candid insights reinforced the importance of addressing usability and reliability issues while demonstrating to agents that their feedback was valued.

### Competitive Analysis
Competitive Analysis To benchmark against industry standards, I conducted a thorough competitive analysis of digital solutions from major players like State Farm, Progressive, Liberty Mutual, and American Modern. This review helped identify best practices and gaps in Pekin Insurance’s offerings.
<img src="/images/insurance-research-strategy/competitive.png" style="max-width:80%; display: flex; margin: 3rem auto;" alt="A service blueprint showing the user flow for claims along with touchpoints and opportunities for improvement" />
- Modern insurance apps provided personalized dashboards, self-service capabilities, and integrated tools for policy management and claims tracking.
- Competitors heavily prioritized mobile accessibility, reflecting the growing importance of on-the-go interactions.

>Impact: These insights established a baseline for user expectations, shaping the vision for an improved digital experience that prioritized seamless, self-service functionality.

### Ticket Analysis
It was clear that data was hard to come by as analytics tools were used minimally. By analyzing two years’ worth of support tickets, I identified recurring pain points that directly impacted user satisfaction and operational efficiency.


#### Heatmapping
- 29% of tickets were related to login failures, reflecting technical debt and outdated authentication processes.
- 16% were misdirected, indicating unclear guidance and possible internal process improvement opportunities.
- The data revealed a persistent lack of intuitive design, leading to reliance on human support for tasks that should be self-service.

<img src="/images/insurance-research-strategy/heatmap.png" style="max-width:30%; display: flex; margin: 3rem auto;" alt="A service blueprint showing the user flow for claims along with touchpoints and opportunities for improvement" />

>Impact: These findings informed immediate priorities for the digital transformation roadmap, including enhanced login experiences and clearer navigation paths.

## Outcomes
Using context mapping, I visualized relationships and dependencies between insured customers, agents, and internal business functions like claims, underwriting, and IT. This exercise highlighted systemic issues.
<img src="/images/insurance-research-strategy/context-map.png" style="max-width:50%; display: flex; margin: 3rem auto;" alt="A service blueprint showing the user flow for claims along with touchpoints and opportunities for improvement" />

>Outcome: The map clarified areas where improved communication and automation could deliver the most value, enabling cross-functional alignment.

### Delivery Mapping
I designed a strategy-to-delivery map to align company goals, department objectives, and measurable outcomes. The map connected opportunities and solutions to strategic initiatives, emphasizing self-service improvements and operational efficiencies.
<img src="/images/insurance-research-strategy/strategy-map.png" style="max-width:70%; display: flex; margin: 3rem auto;" alt="A service blueprint showing the user flow for claims along with touchpoints and opportunities for improvement" />

**Key Elements**
- Defined top-level strategies and linked them to actionable objectives.
- Identified key opportunities, like paperless billing integration and agent onboarding optimization.
- Outlined measurable outcomes, such as cost savings and improved task success rates.

>Impact: This framework enabled leadership and the team to visualize how strategic goals were directly supported by tactical initiatives.


### Tactical Roadmap
Based on the findings from research and discovery, I developed a tactical roadmap to prioritize features for the MVP and subsequent releases (R1, R2).

**MVP & Iterations**
- MVP: Integrated modern authentication, created enterprise customer records, and introduced a modern payment solution.
- R1: Implemented paperless billing, claims status tracking, and digital wallet ID cards.
- R2: Introduced forms for commercial and life insurance as well as first notice of loss features.

>Impact: This phased approach maximized immediate value while ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.


### Impact
The digital transformation at Pekin Insurance began delivering tangible results, marking significant progress in improving user experiences for both agents and insured customers.

- **Fixed and enabled over 90 new agency user experience features in 6 months.** This effort showed a commitment to addressing user pain points and drastically improved user experience feedback from agents. This enabled the organization to decide to open up a previously closed line of business, generating more business.
- **On-track to launch the new customer portal by year-end 2024.** This initiative not only enhances the overall user experience but also positions the company to save $5M annually by improving operational efficiency and reducing support costs.
- **Claims team innovations.** By implementing new processes and technologies, the claims team was better equipped to support customers, reducing friction in critical workflows in their solutions.
- **Alignment with organizational strategy.** Every UX effort directly supported business objectives, such as cost savings, operational efficiencies, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

To showcase these improvements, the portal redesign includes intuitive self-service tools, clear navigation, and modern features that align with customer expectations. The new design prioritizes accessibility, usability, and efficiency, providing a seamless experience across devices.
