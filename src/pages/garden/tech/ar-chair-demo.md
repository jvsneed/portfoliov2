## Caveats & future considerations
This AR experience only works on Apple mobile and tablet devices. You can visit the site on other devices, but the AR functionality wonâ€™t be available. To improve cross-platform compatibility, I should explore alternatives like <model-viewer> or WebXR. If I continue refining this project, I plan to test these options.

## Challenges and process

The most difficult part of this project was designing and developing the mock site itself since I'd be sharing it pubicly. I analyzed Apple's implementation and found that their AR integration relies on the rel="AR" attribute in links to USDZ models. To build my experience:

I created the AR scene using Reality Composer [AR project post](./ar-book-demo.md)
I sourced the 3D asset from Sketchfab
I used reverse image search to find more suitable project images
This project was a great exploration of AR in e-commerce, and I look forward to improving it further.
