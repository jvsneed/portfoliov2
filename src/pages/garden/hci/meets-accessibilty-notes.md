I attended the Smashing Meets Accessibility conference online last week. Betweenthe speakers and the chat, a ton of great links were shared. I collected them in my [bookmarks](/garden/miscellaneous/bookmarks):

**Topics I should explore further**
- Designing for neurodiversity
- More in depth development approaches

**Takeaways/new learnings**
- I redesigned and rebuilt my portfolio in January 2025. I hadn't thoroughly tested it as I wanted to get it out there for job applications. I realized there were some accessibility issues, some I fixed write away (like show active link state on my nav in a way other than color) but others I still need to address, like auto play on video content. Testing zoom between 200 - 400% - this is something I am bad at remembering to test as I test media queries.
- Sara Fossheim (https://fossheim.io) presented on data visualization. She made a comment about ensuring designs are printer friendly...I rarely considered this until now.

Next up, I'll be attending Microsoft's Ability summit in March. I'm looking forward to it!
