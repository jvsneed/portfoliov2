I attended the Smashing Meets Accessibility conference online last week. Between the speakers and the chat, a ton of great links were shared. I collected them in my [bookmarks](/garden/miscellaneous/bookmarks):

## Takeaways & New Learnings  

I redesigned and rebuilt my portfolio in January 2025. Since I was focused on getting it live for job applications, I didn’t test it as thoroughly as I should have. That led to some accessibility issues...some I fixed right away, like ensuring my navigation’s active state wasn’t only indicated by color. Others, like autoplay on video content, still need to be addressed.  

### Accessibility Testing Gaps  
One major area I need to improve is **testing zoom levels between 200–400%**. I often focus on media queries but forget to check zoomed layouts properly.  

### New Considerations  
Sara Fossheim ([fossheim.io](https://fossheim.io)) presented on **data visualization** and made a point about ensuring designs are printer-friendly. That wasn’t something I had thought about much before, but it’s now on my radar.  

### What’s Next  
I’ll be attending **Microsoft’s Ability Summit** in March. Looking forward to it!
