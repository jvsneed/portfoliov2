# Core Accessibility Principles

These are my collected notes on foundational accessibility principles, regularly updated as I learn more.

## WCAG Basics
- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Low color contrast
- Missing alt text
- Keyboard navigation issues

[[Design System Components]] should follow these principles by default.

More detailed color guidelines can be found in my [[Color Contrast Guide]].
