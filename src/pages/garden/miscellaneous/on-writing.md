For as long as I can remember, I've creating and writing something, somewhere, for no one.

When creating extends beyond personal use, the lack of an audience poses an existential question...
>*if what I create isn't seen, does it matter?* 

20th-century existentialists explored this by considering the meaning of creating (mostly writing) in an indifferent universe. Camus compared the human condition to the myth of Sisyphus, who was condemned to push a boulder uphill for eternity only to see it roll back down. In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus describes artistic creation as "the absurd joy par excellence." 

>Am I simply trying to satisfy the desire to give life meaning through creative pursuits?

>As a creative (I wouldn't call myself a writer by any means), is the value of creating derived from the output or the act itself? 

The futility of unacknowledged work can transform into a source of freedom. Camus concludes that "one must imagine Sisyphus happy," suggesting that fulfillment can exist without the desire for external reward. Nietzsche had a similar intuition decades earlier. He admired the honesty of Schopenhauer’s writings, noting that "He is honest because he speaks and writes to himself and for himself." To Nietzsche, a thinker who writes primarily for his own understanding can reach truths that pandering to popular opinion might distort. 

This detachment from external validation is beyond philosophy. The pressure to monetize hobbies and seek engagement can overshadow the joy of creation. Yet, resisting this urge and choosing to create because just to create feels like an act of defiance.


The notion of writing into the void isn't new to the internet. Millions of people post on blogs, social media, and forums, effectively publishing diaries to the world, yet most of this content remains unread. Media scholars discuss the concept of the <a href="https://medium.com/@yfuu0049/imagined-audience-theyre-looking-at-your-social-media-71aae2410d6a" target="_blank" >imagined audience</a>.

>*Leading me to question...who am I justifying my writing to now? Is this note a paradox?*

The truth is, I learn by processing ideas and teaching. I always have. If I don’t create and articulate what I'm learning, I find retention of the information scarce. The practice of creating and writing is beneficial to me. It helps me organize thoughts, develop a voice, and serve as a personal archive. 

We can also view the persistence of unheard voices as part of the democratic ethos of the web. The internet introduces a temporal dimension to the void. What's written today may connect with someone years later. Not all content will be widely read, but the act of participation has value. The web is a place where I've made friends since I was a child in the early 2000s. It has been a vast repository of information, a source of deep inspiration, and at times, a space that has fostered resentment.

I am writing in opposition to the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/-the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister" target="_blank" >dead internet</a> and as an act of rebellion against personalized algorithms. Regardless of whether my words find an audience today or in the distant future, I write because I can. So please, put the feed down and do things you're passionate about (she says to her imaginary audience).
