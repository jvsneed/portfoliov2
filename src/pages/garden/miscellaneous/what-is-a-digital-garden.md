A digital garden is a different way of thinking about personal knowledge spaces online. Unlike traditional blogs where posts are published as finished pieces in reverse chronological order, digital gardens embrace the idea of continuous growth and evolution.

## Key characteristics of digital gardens:

- **Growth over time**: Notes start as seedlings and mature as you revisit and refine them
- **Non-linear**: Ideas connect through organic linking rather than chronological order
- **Learning in public**: Sharing thoughts and knowledge as they develop, not just finished pieces
- **Evolving content**: Notes can be updated and expanded as understanding grows
- **Imperfection welcome**: Not everything needs to be polished or complete

## Why garden digitally?

Digital gardens encourage:
- Active learning through writing
- Building connections between ideas
- Sharing knowledge while it's growing
- Creating a personal knowledge ecosystem
- Learning alongside others

## Different from blogging

Traditional blogs often emphasize:
- Polished, finished articles
- Chronological ordering
- Publication dates
- Comments and engagement metrics

Gardens, in contrast, focus on:
- Work in progress
- Interconnected ideas
- Continuous updates
- Personal growth and learning

## Starting your own garden

Good practices for digital gardening:
1. Start small with seed notes
2. Link liberally between related thoughts
3. Revisit and tend to existing notes
4. Don't worry about perfection
5. Share your learning journey

Digital gardens are spaces for growth, experimentation, and learning in public. They're less about presenting perfect final pieces and more about nurturing ideas over time.
