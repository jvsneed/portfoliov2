Design systems have become the backbone of modern digital product development. They're more than just a collection of UI components—they're a shared language between designers and developers.

Good design systems solve three key problems:

2. **Efficiency**: They reduce duplicate work and speed up development
3. **Scale**: They help teams build complex products that can grow
